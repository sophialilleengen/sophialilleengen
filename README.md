### Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Sophia (she/her)

I am a postdoctoral research associate in astrophysics at the Institute for Computational Cosmology at Durham University. I completed my PhD at the University of Surrey and am a former Pre-Doc at the Center for Computational Astrophysics/Flatiron Institute in NYC. I am interested in understanding stellar streams to learn more about the dark matter around the Milky Way, and contributing to open science.
